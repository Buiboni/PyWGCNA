# PyWGCNA

PyWGCNA is a Python library designed to do Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) 
can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing 
such clusters using the module eigengene for relating modules to one another and 
to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating 
module membership measures. Users can also compare WGCNA from different datasets
including single cell gene markers.

## Installation
will add later

## Tutorials

for now look at jupyter notebook in the test directory
